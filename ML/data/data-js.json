Based on the Cochrane Collaboration in Evidence-based Medicine, the EBT Collaboration was established at the CAAT to foster the development of a process for quality assurance of new toxicity tests for the assessment of safety in humans and the environment. Regulatory safety sciences have undergone remarkably little change in the past fifty years. At the same time, our knowledge in the life sciences is doubling about every seven years. Systematic review and related evidence-based approaches are beginning to be adapted by regulatory agencies like the Environment Protection Agency (EPA), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and the US National Toxicology Program.

You will also learn how to protect yourself and your organization against such forces lurking in the dark. About the Course This course teaches how narrow frames and strong contexts can push good people towards unethical decisions and how they can protect themselves and their organization against ethical blindness. The goal of this course is to empower the participants to analyze the risks of unethical or illegal behavior that might be triggered by powerful contexts. It draws from various disciplines such as management, psychology, sociology, philosophy, and literature, in order to learn what these disciplines contribute to a better understanding of unethical behavior. The course also analyzes some of the most prominent organizational scandals of the recent decades through the lenses of these disciplines. Whenever we hear about ethical scandals, we tend to believe that unethical or illegal behaviour in organizations is driven by character deficiencies of individual actors. Put differently, we simply assume that bad things are done by bad people. However, numerous corporate scandals have demonstrated that even people with a high level of integrity can break the rules if they are put into a strong context. A better understanding of why and under what conditions good people make bad ethical decisions will enable us to better protect individuals as well as their respective organizations against the potentially overwhelming power of the context. It will also enable us to cure societies from problems like corruption. At the end of the course, you are able to: 1. Explain the impact of social context on individual decision making using various theories (from Management, Sociology, Psychology, and Philosophy) 2. Apply these theories to the analysis of some of the most eminent organizational scandals of the recent decades 3. Assess risks of ethical blindness in your own organizational context 4. Design interventions to reduce such risks for yourself and your organization Recommended Background No background expertise is required. The course is open for interested layperson as well as experts who work on related topics, be it as researchers or practitioners (e.g., compliance managers in corporations). Why is this course important for me? Currently, the understanding of why good people make unethical decisions is rather limited, related research is rather fragmented, and the management of such problems in organizations is overly simplistic, legalistic, and inadequate. Understanding contexts, including the dangers of routines, the mindlessness of our daily decisions, and the healing power of mindful decision-making routines is of increasing importance. In this course, you will learn the latest knowledge and the appropriate tool box for dealing with ethical challenges that you will face throughout your life! What do I need to follow this course? We build bridges between various scientific disciplines and will familiarize you with those disciplines smoothly.

To\nquantify the mismatch between the output trajectory of the approximation and of\nthat the original system, we use the notion of so-called simulation functions.\nIn particular, each subsystem in the concrete network and its corresponding one\nin the abstract network is related through a local simulation function. We show\nthat if the local simulation functions satisfy a certain small-gain type\ncondition developed for a network of infinitely many subsystems, then the\naggregation of the individual simulation functions provides an overall\nsimulation function between the overall abstraction and the concrete network.\nFor a network of linear switched systems, we systematically construct local\nabstractions and local simulation functions, where the required conditions are\nexpressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities and can be efficiently\ncomputed. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach through an\napplication to frequency control in a power gird with a switched (i.e.\ntime-varying) topology.","file":"hashfile1","fileIdx":78,"thumbnail":"https:\/\/uploads5.wikiart.org\/00244\/images\/ancient-egyptian-painting\/tomb-of-nakht-11-4.jpg","author":["testing"],"keyWords":["simulation","system","controller"],"interests":["Science"],"minumunContribution":1,"downloadCount":0,"viewCount":0,"subscriberInsti":[],"subscriberUser":[]},{"intiId":[],"idEth":"def","name":"App Deployment, Debugging, and Performance","desc":"In this course, application developers learn how to design and develop cloud-native applications that seamlessly integrate managed services from Google Cloud.

Through positive, real life examples, pre-scripting, rehearsal and peer coaching, GVV builds the skill, the confidence and likelihood that we will act on our values more often and more successfully.

However, domain adaptation\n(DA) is needed to alleviate the problem of domain shifts that typically occurs\nbetween video data captured in source and target do-mains. Given the laborious\ntask of collecting and annotating videos, and the subjective bias due to\nambiguity among adjacent intensity levels, weakly-supervised learning (WSL)is\ngaining attention in such applications. Yet, most state-of-the-art WSL models\nare typically formulated as regression problems, and do not leverage the\nordinal relation between intensity levels, nor the temporal coherence of\nmultiple consecutive frames. This paper introduces a new deep learn-ing model\nfor weakly-supervised DA with ordinal regression(WSDA-OR), where videos in\ntarget domain have coarse la-bels provided on a periodic basis. The WSDA-OR\nmodel enforces ordinal relationships among the intensity levels as-signed to\nthe target sequences, and associates multiple relevant frames to sequence-level\nlabels (instead of a single frame). In particular, it learns discriminant and\ndomain-invariant feature representations by integrating multiple in-stance\nlearning with deep adversarial DA, where soft Gaussian labels are used to\nefficiently represent the weak ordinal sequence-level labels from the target\ndomain. The proposed approach was validated on the RECOLA video dataset as\nfully-labeled source domain, and UNBC-McMaster video data as weakly-labeled\ntarget domain. We have also validated WSDA-OR on BIOVID and Fatigue (private)\ndatasets for sequence level estimation. Experimental results indicate that our\napproach can provide a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art\nmodels, allowing to achieve a greater localization accuracy.","file":"hashfile1","fileIdx":86,"thumbnail":"https:\/\/uploads5.wikiart.org\/00244\/images\/ancient-egyptian-painting\/tomb-of-nakht-19-2.jpg","author":["testing"],"keyWords":["domain","target","intensity"],"interests":["Machine Learning"],"minumunContribution":1,"downloadCount":0,"viewCount":0,"subscriberInsti":[],"subscriberUser":[]},{"intiId":[],"idEth":"def","name":"Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation","desc":"It has been more than 20 years since this classic book on formal languages, automata theory, and computational complexity was first published.
